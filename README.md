## User_Story
In modern days, messaging has become part of our daily lives. With the increase of work from home jobs, classes online, traveling and other long distance cirumstances, maintaining connection with family, friends and coworkers has been such a neccessity. This has inspired us to create a messaging app, as it will always be a tool we will need in our modern lives. 


## Description
An easy to use messenger app that allows users to make an account, log in and send messages to other online users. This project was made with node, javascript, express.js, handlebars, MySQL, Sequlize ORM socket io and express-sessions and cookies were used for authentication. We built this project to challenge ourselves as developers and create a program that we could use. We learned how to initialize and integrate socket IO, work with Handlebars, deploy our project using Heroku, and practiced creating mySql models and relationships.


## Installation  

No installation is necessary. To use the application click on the link below:

Our github repo:   
(https://github.com/smokhadar/project2main-catchUp)


## Usage
Once users have clicked on the first link above, they may create an account by clicking on the sign up button on the right side of page. There are moons located on both pages and clicking them changes the page to a dark mode. To return to the default light mode, click on one of the suns located below the login and sign up buttons. Users may create a username, a password that must be at least 8 characters long and be made up of numbers and letters, and enter their email to complete the signing up process. After clicking on the sign up button users will be able to see what friends are online when they look to the right of their window. They will then be able to receive messages from friends, text encased in green, and will be able to send messages, text encased in magenta. They may send messages by writing in the rouneded text box and clicking on the green paper-plane.
